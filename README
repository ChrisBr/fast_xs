= fast_xs, a fast C extension for cleaning XML

== Overview

  The original fast_xs method is based on the xchar code by Sam Ruby:

    http://intertwingly.net/blog/2005/09/28/XML-Cleansing

  _why also packages an older version with Hpricot (patch in progress).
  It should be compatible with the latest version of this code.

  This is an almost exact translation (to the best of my knowledge :) of
  Sam's original implementation, but it does escape "&quot;".
  XML::Builder as packaged in Rails 2.0 will be automatically use
  fast_xs if available.
